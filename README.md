Have you ever visited a crowded restaurant? You can barely fit in, which makes you wish you had chosen a different time or date. Well, it's really no different with experiencing nature in the national parks of Finland – why should everyone be on the same parks on the same routes at the same time? For no reason, obviously – and we have a solution for this. 
 
Adventure Available – or in short AdventureA – is an easy to use visualising tool for the national parks of Finland. We provide a tangible and intuitive user interface where you can see easily see the areas and routes people usually visit. This helps you plan your trip to the beautiful and peaceful Finnish nature. 
 
As a bonus, if you are unfamiliar with the Finnish nature, our app presents you the monthly average climate conditions of the parks as well as wild animals spotted around Finland. 

 
Adventure Available – distribute people, enable nature
